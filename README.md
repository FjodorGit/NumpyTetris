# NumpyTetris
Tetris played in the Terminal. Programmend completly in Numpy. Originaly intended for training reinforcement agents and later use them on the jitris.com. Human-play is possible in the terminal, though not pretty. The preview screen and and hold area are omitted in the human-play version, as printing out those two screens as well would make the game unreadable.
